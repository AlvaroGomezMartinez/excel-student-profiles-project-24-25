## Chavez Excel Academy and The Department of Academic Technology<br/><br/>Excel Student Profiles Project 24-25
This is a Google Apps Scripts project that supports Excel Academy's counselor secretary. The objective is to create a student profile (a Google Doc) that teachers at Excel can reference for student information. The workflow involves students going to a clerk and having a headshot taken. The headshot is placed in a shared network drive as a .bmp file. The counselor's secretary gets the picture files and moves them to a Google Drive folder, opens the Google Worksheet (database), runs the Google Apps Script function that converts the .bmp files to .jpg's and adds the url's of the .jpg files to the Google sheet. The secretary then runs an Autocrat job that creates the profile sheets and embeds the URL of the pictures in each separate file. The Excel teachers can then see the profile pages of their students.<br/><br/>
